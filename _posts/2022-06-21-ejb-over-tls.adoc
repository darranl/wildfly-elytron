The *https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/tree/master/ejb-mutual-tls[ejb-mutual-tls]* example
demonstrates how to use Elytron to secure EJBs with mutual TLS
authentication. It also shows how to restrict access to EJBs, configuring a FileSystem realm protected by SASL
authentication, and accessed using a credential store. This example focuses on the TLS configuration, so if you wish to
learn more you can refer to blog posts on
https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/advanced-ejb-security/[configuring the FileSystem realm and SASL mechanism],
and on https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/ejb-over-http/[connecting with HTTP].

== An Overview of Mutual TLS authentication

In a standard TLS handshake, the server presents its certificate to the client, which then inspects the contents and
signature. If the certificate matches one that the client trusts, or is signed by an entity that it trusts, the server's
identity is verified and a key exchange is performed to secure the session. In mutual TLS authentication, the client also
presents its own certificate, which the server will then use to verify the identity of the client.

Using the Elytron subsystem, a WildFly server can form a mutual TLS connection with a remote client. To do so, the client
will generate a certificate, which the server will import into its truststore. The client will be configured to present
the certificate when performing the TLS handshake, which the server will verify using its truststore.

=== Generating the Client Certificate

In order for the client to use a certificate, it must be signed by a server-trusted entity. For the purposes of this
demonstration, we will self-sign a certificate and then import it into the server's truststore. However, such
certificates are generally treated as insecure since the identity cannot be externally verified. To use a certificate
signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, take a look at this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/obtaining-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-using-the-wildfly-cli/[blog post].

We will begin by generating a 2048-bit key pair, and saving it to a local file with the alias `client`. Using the
Java *keytool*, we store it in a PKCS #12 keystore:

[source,shell]
----
$ keytool -genkeypair -alias client -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -keystore /PATH/TO/tlsClient.keystore -dname "CN=client" -storepass clientKeySecret
----

Note that we have also set the common name on the key to `client` (using the option `-dname "CN=client"`). Once the key 
pair is created, we export the certificate to a file:

[source,shell]
----
$ keytool -exportcert -keystore /PATH/TO/tlsClient.keystore -alias client -storepass clientKeySecret -file /PATH/TO/tlsClient.cer
----

=== Generating the Server Certificate

We will now perform a similar configuration for the WildFly server. Start the server, and then in another terminal
connect to it using the management CLI:

[source,shell]
----
$ WILDFLY_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect
----

(_Note: In this post, replace_  `WILDFLY_HOME` _with the actual path to your WildFly installation._)

We will use the Elytron subsystem to create a keystore to hold the server's key pair. The keystore will be
saved in the server configuration directory, relative to `jboss.server.config.dir`:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/key-store=tlsKeyStore:add(path=tlsServer.keystore,relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir,credential-reference={clear-text=serverKeySecret})
----

Then, we generate a key pair with alias `localhost`, and save it to the keystore. Like with the client,
we also specify the server's common name (`distinguished-name="CN=localhost"`).

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/key-store=tlsKeyStore:generate-key-pair(alias=localhost,algorithm=RSA,key-size=2048,validity=365,credential-reference={clear-text=serverKeySecret},distinguished-name="CN=localhost")

/subsystem=elytron/key-store=tlsKeyStore:store()
----

The self-signed certificate is exported to a file in the configuration directory:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/key-store=tlsKeyStore:export-certificate(alias=localhost,path=tlsServer.cer,relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir)
----

Finally, we create a key manager, which will be used to access the keystore during the TLS handshake:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/key-manager=tlsKM:add(key-store=tlsKeyStore,credential-reference={clear-text=serverKeySecret})
----

=== Importing the Certificates

Since we are already connected to the server, we will import the client certificate first. We configure a new truststore for holding certificates:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/key-store=tlsTrustStore:add(path=tlsServer.truststore,relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir,credential-reference={clear-text=serverTrustSecret})
----

We import the client certificate, specifying it with its alias, and then save it to the truststore file. Since this is
a self-signed certificate, we will not validate its authenticity.

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/key-store=tlsTrustStore:import-certificate(alias=client,path=/PATH/TO/tlsClient.cer,credential-reference={clear-text=serverTrustSecret},trust-cacerts=true,validate=false)

/subsystem=elytron/key-store=tlsTrustStore:store()
----

We also configure a trust manager, which will verify the certificate during the TLS handshake:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/trust-manager=tlsTM:add(key-store=tlsTrustStore)
----

With the server now setup, we return to the client. Open a new terminal and navigate to the root folder of this
example. We use the *keytool* once again, identify the server's certificate by its alias and importing it into a client
truststore:

[source,shell]
----
$ keytool -importcert -keystore /PATH/TO/tlsClient.truststore -storepass clientTrustSecret -alias localhost -trustcacerts -file /WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/configuration/tlsServer.cer -noprompt
----

At this point, the client and server both have their corresponding key pairs, and trust the certificates of the other.
The TLS configuration is complete.

== Configuring the Credential Store

We will now setup the client login using the SASL authentication mechanism. First, we use the *elytron-tool* to generate a
credential store to securely store the login details:

[source,shell]
----
$ WILDFLY_HOME/bin/elytron-tool.sh credential-store --create --location "/PATH/TO/tlsCredStore.cs" --password clientStorePassword
----

Then, we add the `example_user` identity to this credential store:

[source,shell]
----
$ WILDFLY_HOME/bin/elytron-tool.sh credential-store --location "/PATH/TO/tlsCredStore.cs" --password clientStorePassword --add example_user --secret examplePwd1!
----

== Configuring the WildFly Client

Now that we have our keystore, truststore, and credential store configured, we need to tell the Elytron client how to
access them. From the root of this example, navigate to the directory at `src/main/resources` and open the
`wildfly-config.xml` configuration file in a text editor. Upon inspecting the file, we note the credential store
configuration, which will be used to access the client's credentials when establishing a connection to the server:

[source,xml]
.wildfly-config.xml
----
<credential-stores>
    <credential-store name="tlsCredStore">
        <attributes>
            <attribute name="keyStoreType" value="JCEKS"/>
            <attribute name="location" value="/PATH/TO/tlsCredStore.cs"/>
        </attributes>
        <protection-parameter-credentials>
            <clear-password password="clientStorePassword"/>
        </protection-parameter-credentials>
    </credential-store>
</credential-stores>
----

Similarly, the client also records the location of the PKCS #12 keystore and truststore. This will be used to access the key pair and server certificate during connection establishment:

[source,xml]
.wildfly-config.xml
----
<key-stores>
    <key-store name="tlsClientTrustStore" type="PKCS12">
        <file name="/PATH/TO/tlsClient.truststore"/>
        <key-store-clear-password password="clientTrustSecret"/>
    </key-store>
    <key-store name="tlsClientKeyStore" type="PKCS12">
        <file name="/PATH/TO/tlsClient.keystore"/>
        <key-store-clear-password password="clientKeySecret"/>
    </key-store>
</key-stores>
----

In all three locations, we will need to replace `/PATH/TO` with the filepath to the various stores.

Looking further into the configuration, we notice the setup for the user authentication under the
`<authentication-configurations>` tag. The client uses the configured username, and then retrieves the password from the
credential store. It also specifies the SASL authentication mechanism to use, in this case `SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS`.
Finally, note that the `<providers>` tag configures the client to register the Elytron providers.

[source,xml]
.wildfly-config.xml
----
<authentication-configurations>
    <configuration name="example-config">
        <set-user-name name="example_user"/>
        <credentials>
            <credential-store-reference store="tlsCredStore" alias="example_user"/>
        </credentials>
        <sasl-mechanism-selector selector="SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS"/>
        <providers>
            <use-service-loader/>
        </providers>
    </configuration>
</authentication-configurations>
----

Below this is the configuration for the TLS connection, under the `<ssl-contexts>` tag. The configuration specifies both
the truststore and keystore to use for the connection. It also specifies the cipher suites and protocols it supports.

[source,xml]
.wildfly-config.xml
----
<ssl-contexts>
    <ssl-context name="example-tls">
        <key-store-ssl-certificate key-store-name="tlsClientKeyStore" alias="client">
            <key-store-clear-password password="clientKeySecret"/>
        </key-store-ssl-certificate>
        <trust-store key-store-name="tlsClientTrustStore"/>
        <cipher-suite names="TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256" selector="DEFAULT"/>
        <protocol names="TLSv1.3 TLSv1.2"/>
    </ssl-context>
</ssl-contexts>
----

Elytron does not enable TLS 1.3 by default, so we manually do so using the `<cipher-suite names>` attribute. For more
information on configuring TLS 1.3, take a look at this
https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/tls-13-with-wildfly/[blog post].

Finally, under the `<jboss-ejb-client>` tag, the client will attempt to access the EJB on localhost port 8443, the
WildFly server default for HTTP over TLS connections.

[source,xml]
.wildfly-config.xml
----
<jboss-ejb-client xmlns="urn:jboss:wildfly-client-ejb:3.2">
    <connections>
        <connection uri="remote+https://127.0.0.1:8443"/>
    </connections>
</jboss-ejb-client>
----

== Configuring the Server

We will now configure the server to require a login. Returning to the terminal with the management CLI.

=== Configuring the Security Domain

We create a FileSystem realm called `tlsFsRealm` in the server configuration directory:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=tlsFsRealm:add(path=tlsFsRealmUsers, relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir)
----

Then, we add the `example_user` identity to the realm, and give it the `guest` role:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=tlsFsRealm:add-identity(identity=example_user)

/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=tlsFsRealm:set-password(identity=example_user, clear={password=examplePwd1!})

/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=tlsFsRealm:add-identity-attribute(identity=example_user, name=Roles, value=[guest])
----

Next, we will configure the security domain to use the filesystem realm:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/security-domain=tlsFsSD:add(realms=[{realm=tlsFsRealm}],default-realm=tlsFsRealm,permission-mapper=default-permission-mapper)
----

Afterwards, we add a mapping to the security domain into the `ejb3` subsystem, for securing the EJB:

[source]
----
/subsystem=ejb3/application-security-domain=tlsApp:add(security-domain=tlsFsSD)
----

=== Enabling SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS

Elytron supports two types of authentication: `HTTP authentication` and `SASL authentication`. We will use the SASL
authentication mechanism `SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS`, which performs channel binding with the TLS session. We create a
`sasl-authentication-factory` that uses the security domain we configured previously:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/sasl-authentication-factory=tlsSASLFactory:add(sasl-server-factory=configured,security-domain=tlsFsSD,mechanism-configurations=[{mechanism-name=SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS}])
----

=== Configuring the Remote Connector

The final step is to configure a remote connector that makes use of both an HTTPS listener and the SASL
authentication factory. We add a `server-ssl-context` that references both the keystore and truststore used by
the server, and manually enable TLS 1.3 support:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/server-ssl-context=tlsSSC:add(key-manager=tlsKM,protocols=["TLSv1.3","TLSv1.2"],cipher-suite-names=TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,trust-manager=tlsTM,need-client-auth=true)
----

We then configure the `https-listener` in the `undertow` subsystem to use this SSL context:

[source]
----
/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=https:write-attribute(name=ssl-context,value=tlsSSC)
----

Now, we configure a new `http-connector` called `tlsConnector`, which references both the `https-listener` and the
`sasl-authentication-factory`:

[source]
----
/subsystem=remoting/http-connector=tlsConnector:add(connector-ref=https,sasl-authentication-factory=tlsSASLFactory)
----

Lastly, we add the connector to the `ejb3` subsystem to be used when the remote client attempts to connect:

[source]
----
/subsystem=ejb3/service=remote:write-attribute(name=connectors,value=[tlsConnector])
----

== Summary

This blog post has demonstrated how to configure the WildFly server and client to perform mutual TLS authentication for
forming connections, and how to use SASL authentication and a credential store to securely invoke an EJB with privileged
identities. Although this post focused on mutual TLS authentication, similar steps can be followed for traditional
connections. For example, if only the server will present a certificate, then we do not need to export a client certificate,
and then import it into the server truststore.
